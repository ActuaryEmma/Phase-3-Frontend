        <p>
          Write Out Loud is a national (indeed, international) hub for
          participation in poetry, encouraging everyone who writes poetry – from
          still-too-nervous-to-do-open-mic to Nobel Prize winner – to share
          their words with others. We're not just the website (more on that
          later), but seeing as you're here, let's tell you all about that
          first. <br />
          <br />
          The Write Out Loud website has been around since 2005. It's unique in
          what it brings together, and what it offers to our members. Here
          you’ll find our unparallelled news section (covering news from
          publishers, poets, events, gig reviews and book reviews), our gig
          guide (where you can find out what's happening near you) and, of
          course, our blogs (where you can post your work, and read and comment
          on work posted by others).
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this is designed to encourage interaction in a comfortable and
          inclusive atmosphere, which helps explain why over 45,000 people visit
          the website each month, and why they keep coming back. In order for
          you to get the most benefit out of the Write Out Loud site, here’s a
          guide to what you’ll find here.

            <h3>News</h3>
            <p>
              The latest news from the world of poetry, including reviews of
              events and books, details of competitions, and much much more. If
              you think there’s something we should know about, or you want to
              submit a review of an event you have attended, you can contact our
              Features editor at news@writeoutloud.net

            <h3>Gig guide</h3>
            <p>
              Poetry events are an opportunity to share your work, meet up with
              other poets, socialise, and listen to a wide range of styles,
              ideas, forms, voices, and experiences. Our gig guide is the best
              way to find out what's going on in your area, and is one of the
              most comprehensive guides there is. If you find a night near you
              which isn't using it, do let them know they can post their events
              on the site for free (and updating or changing it is easy). If
              they need a helping hand, they can email gig@writeoutloud.net

            <h3>Blogs</h3>
            <p>
              The place where you can share your work and read work other WOL
              members have posted. Unsurprisingly, this is one of the busiest
              areas of the site! If someone's poem moves you, makes you laugh,
              or inspires you to go off and write a piece of your own, do take a
              minute or two to let the author know by commenting on their work.
              We all love to get feedback on what we've posted.

            <h3>Profiles</h3>
            <p>
              Creating a profile when you join Write Out Loud gives you the
              opportunity to tell us a bit about yourself. What brought you
              here? What does poetry do for you? What do you hope others will
              get from your work? Let us all know.

            <h3>Galleries</h3>
            <p>
              Photos from poetry events and readings, showing poets of all ages,
              backgrounds, poetic styles and levels of experience.

          As we said earlier, WOL isn’t just the website. In 2015, we became a
          Community Interest Company (CIC) with a mission to make poetry more
          widely appreciated and available. We believe passionately in the power
          of poetry to bring enjoyment, fulfillment and positive change to
          people’s lives, and our aim is to bring more people to poetry and
          poetry to more people. WOL is an information resource for people
          wanting to set up poetry events where they live, and we also support
          individual poets, poetry organisations and groups across the country,
          via a monthly newsletter (and this website). As you’ll see from the
          gig guide, we have monthly open-floor poetry nights in Marsden,
          Huddersfield, Middleton, Sale, Stockport and Wigan, as well as
          irregular events across the North of England.
